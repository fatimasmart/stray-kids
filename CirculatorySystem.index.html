                <p>The circulatory system is like a highway for your body, made up of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and
                    capillaries), and blood. Its main job is to transport oxygen and nutrients to every cell in your body and to carry
                    waste
                    products away. Think of the heart as the pump that pushes blood, the arteries as roads that take blood away from the
                    heart, and the veins as roads that bring blood back to the heart.</p>
